Smartlinker is a toolbar on the WordPress TinyMCE editor that enables you to

== Description ==

Smartlinker is a toolbar on the WordPress TinyMCE editor that enables you to
hyperlink words and phrases in your blog. Type word/phrase, select and right
click to get a list of hyperlinks (see <a
href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/smartlinker/screenshots/">screenshot</a>).
A word/phrase can be the name of a person, place or thing. The web pages (17.2 million) are crawled from the world wide web.

The choice of a web page is guided by criterias like availibility of a picture describing the word, quality of description,
